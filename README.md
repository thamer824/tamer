# Self-Learn MindFitness Platform

The purpose of this project is to allow everyone, everywhere to access our trainings and to finish them in their own pace.

The E-learning platform is a webspace or portal for educational content and resources that offers a participant everything they need in one place: trainings, resources, opportunities to meet and chat with other participants, ... . It is also an excellent way for the participant and the coach to monitor the progress.
